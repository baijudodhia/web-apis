# Web APIs

Holds simple examples to implementation standard Web APIs from [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API)

1. [Broadcast Channel](https://baijudodhia.github.io/web-apis/broadcast-channel/): This example covers the usage of the Broadcast Channel API. It allows communication between different windows or tabs of the same origin. This is really handy for scenarios where you want to keep multiple parts of a web app in sync. The example should show you how to set up a broadcast channel, send messages through it, and receive those messages on the other end.

1. [Drag and Drop](https://baijudodhia.github.io/web-apis/drag-n-drop/): The Drag and Drop API is all about making your web app more interactive. It lets you easily enable drag-and-drop behavior for elements on your page. This can be super useful for creating features like reordering lists or dragging files into an upload area. The example should walk you through setting up draggable elements and handling the drop event.

2. [Web Workers](https://baijudodhia.github.io/web-apis/web-workers/): The Web Workers API is a way to run JavaScript code in the background without blocking the main thread of your web app. This is particularly useful for tasks that are computationally intensive and might otherwise slow down your UI. In the example, you'll likely learn how to create a basic web worker, send and receive messages from it, and see how it can improve the performance of your app.
